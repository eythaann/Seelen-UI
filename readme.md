## Getting Started & Installation
You can choose from different installation options based on your preference:

### Microsoft Store <em>(recommended)</em>
Download the latest version from the [Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P67C2D4T9FB?ocid=pdpshare) page. This is the recommended option because you will receive updates and a secure version of the program.

### Winget
Install the latest version using:

``` pwsh
winget install --id Seelen.SeelenUI
``` 
This option also uses the signed `.msix` package and ensures you have the latest secure version.

### .msix Installer
Download the `.msix` installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/eythaann/seelen-ui/releases) page. This package is signed, ensuring a secure installation.

### Setup.exe
Download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/eythaann/seelen-ui/releases) page and run the `setup.exe` installer. This option is less recommended as the installer is not signed, which may cause it to be flagged as a potential threat by some antivirus programs.


## Usage

Once installed or extracted, simply open the program. The easy-to-use and intuitive GUI will guide you through the configuration process. Customize your window management experience effortlessly.
